## `cov_mx` function calculates the covariance matrix of the two
## variables and automatically deals with the missing value

def cov_mx(matrix):
  '''
  Covariance measures the extent to which corresponding observations
  from two sets of ordered variables vary in a direction.

  parameters:
  -----------
  matrix (2D np.array): a matrix that contains one or more than one random variable

  Return:
  -------
  cov_matrix (2D np.array): a matrix that contains the correlation between random variables in the input matrix
  '''
  return
